# Non-Recursive-Fibonacci-Number


## Goal 
A practice of dynamic programming on non-recursive fibonnaci number function with ES6 syntax

## Benefit 
Faster  computation time with a O(n) time complexity compared with recursive solution

## Testcase
n = 8181 

## How to run 
```
# Please have node installed
$ node fibon practice.js
```
